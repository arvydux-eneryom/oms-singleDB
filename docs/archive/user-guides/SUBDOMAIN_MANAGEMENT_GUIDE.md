# Subdomain Management Guide

## Overview

The Subdomain Management feature allows system administrators to create and manage separate tenant environments within the Operation Management System (OMS). Each subdomain represents a different company or organization with its own isolated space, users, and data.

**Who is this for?**
- System Administrators who need to set up new client organizations
- Managers who oversee multiple tenant accounts

## Prerequisites

- You must be logged in as a system administrator
- You must have `is_system` permission enabled on your account

## Managing Subdomains

### Accessing Subdomain Management

1. Log in to your OMS system account
2. Navigate to **Subdomains** from the main menu
3. You'll see a list of all subdomains associated with your system

### Viewing Subdomain List

The subdomain list shows:
- **Company Name** - The organization's display name
- **Subdomain** - The unique subdomain identifier (e.g., `acme` in `acme.yourdomain.com`)
- **Full Domain** - The complete URL for accessing the tenant
- **User Count** - Number of users assigned to this tenant
- **Created Date** - When the subdomain was created

**Note:** You can only see subdomains that belong to your system. Subdomains from other systems are automatically filtered out.

## Creating a New Subdomain

### Step 1: Navigate to Create Page

1. From the Subdomain list, click **"Create New Subdomain"** or **"Add Subdomain"** button
2. You'll be taken to the subdomain creation form

### Step 2: Fill in Required Information

#### Company Name
- **Required:** Yes
- **Maximum Length:** 255 characters
- **Description:** The full name of the organization/company
- **Example:** ‚úÖ `Acme Corporation`, `Smith & Associates`

#### Subdomain
- **Required:** Yes
- **Format:** Alphanumeric characters only (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
- **Maximum Length:** 8 characters
- **Must be unique:** Cannot already exist in the system
- **Description:** The unique identifier that will appear in the URL

**Valid Examples:**
- ‚úÖ `acme`
- ‚úÖ `smith123`
- ‚úÖ `ABC456`

**Invalid Examples:**
- ‚ùå `acme-corp` (contains hyphen)
- ‚ùå `acme_co` (contains underscore)
- ‚ùå `acme corp` (contains space)
- ‚ùå `acme@123` (contains special character)
- ‚ùå `verylong123` (exceeds 8 characters)

### Step 3: Submit Creation

1. Review the information you entered
2. Click **"Create Subdomain"** or **"Save"** button
3. Wait for confirmation message

### What Happens After Creation

When you create a subdomain, the system automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Creates a new tenant record for the organization
2. ‚úÖ Generates a unique domain (e.g., `acme.yourdomain.com`)
3. ‚úÖ Associates the domain with your system ID
4. ‚úÖ Links your user account to the new tenant
5. ‚úÖ Marks your account as a tenant user (`is_tenant = true`)
6. ‚úÖ Redirects you back to the subdomain list

**Success Message:** "Subdomain successfully created."

## Editing an Existing Subdomain

### Step 1: Access Edit Page

1. From the Subdomain list, locate the subdomain you want to edit
2. Click the **"Edit"** button or pencil icon
3. The edit form will load with current information

### Step 2: Update Information

You can modify:
- **Company Name** - Update the organization's display name
- **Subdomain** - Change the subdomain identifier

**Important:** Due to system validation, you must change the subdomain text when updating. You cannot save without modifying the subdomain value.

### Step 3: Manage Users

On the edit page, you can also:
- View all users assigned to this tenant
- **Revoke User Access** - Click "Remove" or "Revoke" to unassign a user from the tenant

### Step 4: Save Changes

Two save options:
1. **"Save"** - Saves changes and stays on the edit page
2. **"Save & Close"** - Saves changes and returns to the subdomain list

### What Happens After Update

When you update a subdomain:

1. ‚úÖ Domain name is updated (e.g., from `oldname.yourdomain.com` to `newname.yourdomain.com`)
2. ‚úÖ Tenant name is synchronized with the new company name
3. ‚úÖ All existing user relationships are maintained
4. ‚úÖ The subdomain remains accessible at the new URL

**Success Message:** "Subdomain successfully updated."

## Deleting a Subdomain

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Deletion is Permanent

Deleting a subdomain will:
- Remove the subdomain and domain records
- Delete the associated tenant
- Remove all user-tenant relationships
- This action **cannot be undone**

### Step 1: Locate Subdomain

1. From the Subdomain list, find the subdomain to delete
2. Review the subdomain information carefully

### Step 2: Confirm Deletion

1. Click the **"Delete"** button or trash icon
2. Confirm the deletion when prompted
3. Wait for the system to process

### What Happens After Deletion

The system will:

1. ‚úÖ Detach all users from the tenant
2. ‚úÖ Clean up the `tenant_user` relationship table
3. ‚úÖ Delete the tenant record
4. ‚úÖ Delete the domain record
5. ‚úÖ Show confirmation message

**Success Message:** "Subdomain and all it's users successfully deleted."

**Note:** The actual user accounts are not deleted, only their association with this tenant.

## Subdomain Redirect Feature

### Quick Access to Tenants

The Redirect feature provides a quick way to access tenant environments:

1. Navigate to **Subdomains ‚Üí Redirect**
2. The system automatically redirects you to the most recently created subdomain
3. You'll be logged in with a secure auto-login token

**How it works:**
- System retrieves all your subdomains
- Orders them by creation date (newest first)
- Redirects to the first subdomain
- Generates a temporary signed URL valid for 10 minutes

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Error: "The subdomain has already been taken"

**Error:** When creating or editing, you see: "The subdomain has already been taken."

**Cause:** Another tenant is already using this subdomain identifier.

**Solution:**
1. Choose a different subdomain name
2. Add numbers or variations (e.g., `acme2`, `acme123`)
3. Check with your team to ensure uniqueness

### Error: "The subdomain format is invalid"

**Error:** Validation fails with: "The subdomain format is invalid."

**Cause:** The subdomain contains invalid characters.

**Solution:**
1. Remove all special characters (-, _, @, etc.)
2. Remove spaces
3. Use only letters (a-z, A-Z) and numbers (0-9)
4. Ensure length is 8 characters or less

### Error: "The subdomain field is required"

**Error:** "The subdomain field is required."

**Cause:** You left the subdomain field empty.

**Solution:**
Fill in both Company Name and Subdomain fields before submitting.

### Cannot Save Edit Without Changing Subdomain

**Issue:** When editing, you must change the subdomain even if you only want to update the company name.

**Cause:** Current validation requires the subdomain to be different from existing value.

**Workaround:**
1. Change the subdomain to a new value
2. Or create a support ticket if you need to keep the same subdomain

## Best Practices

### Subdomain Naming

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use short, memorable names
- Include company/client identifier
- Use lowercase for consistency
- Keep it professional and brand-appropriate
- Example: `acme`, `smith`, `techco`

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Use offensive or inappropriate terms
- Make it overly complex
- Use confusing abbreviations
- Example: `a1b2c3d4` (hard to remember)

### Security Considerations

üîí **Important Security Notes:**

1. **User Access Control**
   - Regularly review user assignments
   - Remove users who no longer need access
   - Each tenant has isolated data

2. **Subdomain Visibility**
   - Subdomains are system-scoped
   - You only see subdomains for your system
   - Other system administrators cannot see your subdomains

3. **Auto-Login Tokens**
   - Redirect tokens expire after 10 minutes
   - Tokens are cryptographically signed
   - Each token is single-use and user-specific

### Planning Before Creation

Before creating a subdomain:

1. ‚úÖ Confirm the company/organization name
2. ‚úÖ Choose an appropriate subdomain identifier
3. ‚úÖ Verify the subdomain isn't already in use
4. ‚úÖ Document the subdomain for your records
5. ‚úÖ Plan which users will need access

## Pagination and Search

### Working with Large Lists

- The system displays 10 subdomains per page
- Use pagination controls at the bottom to navigate
- Subdomains are ordered by creation date (newest first)
- If you have more than 10 subdomains, use the page numbers to browse

## Next Steps

After creating a subdomain:

1. **Set Up Initial User** - Your account is automatically linked
2. **Add More Users** - Invite team members to the tenant
3. **Configure Tenant Settings** - Set up organization-specific preferences
4. **Test Access** - Verify the subdomain URL works correctly
5. **Inform Stakeholders** - Share the subdomain URL with relevant users

## Technical Details (For Administrators)

### Database Structure

**Tables Involved:**
- `tenants` - Stores tenant records with JSON data column
- `domains` - Stores domain and subdomain information
- `users` - User accounts
- `tenant_user` - Many-to-many relationship pivot table

### Validation Rules

**Company Name:**
```
- Required: Yes
- Type: String
- Max Length: 255 characters
```

**Subdomain:**
```
- Required: Yes
- Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$ (alphanumeric only)
- Max Length: 8 characters
- Unique: Yes (across all domains)
```

### System Behavior

**Multi-Tenancy:**
- Each tenant has isolated data via `tenant_id`
- System uses `system_id` for additional scoping
- Domains have foreign key constraints to tenants

**Cascade Deletion:**
- Deleting a domain cascades to tenant if configured
- User relationships are manually cleaned up
- `tenant_user` pivot records are explicitly deleted

### Configuration

**Central Domain:**
The base domain is configured in `config/tenancy.central_domains`:
```php
'central_domains' => [
    'yourdomain.com' // Your central domain
]
```

Full subdomain format: `{subdomain}.{central_domain}`

### Auto-Login Implementation

**Redirect Feature:**
- Uses Laravel's `temporarySignedRoute()`
- Route name: `auto-login`
- Expiration: 10 minutes
- Parameters: `user` (ID), `subdomain` (text)
- Signature prevents tampering
